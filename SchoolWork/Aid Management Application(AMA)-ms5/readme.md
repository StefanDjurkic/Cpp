# Aid Management Application
This is a final project for my first year cpp course.
This project completes an application that manages the list of goods that need to be shipped to 
a disaster area. The client application tracks the quantity of items needed, tracks the quantity
on hand, and stores the information in a file for future use. As it stands the application is attached to
a tester module that instructs us what to enter, however, a manual entry system can easily replace it.
